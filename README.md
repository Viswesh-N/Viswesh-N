I am a final year at IIT Kharagpur, pursuing my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering . I am currently working with Prof. Igor Gilitschenski on developing learning-based state estimation pipelines for the navigation of autonomous vehicles in unforseen environments, at theToronto Intelligent Systems Lab at UofT.

My research interests lie in multi-agent robotics, state estimation, and I am eager to apply reinforcement learning techniques to solve autonomous driving and other robotic tasks.

In my free time, I love playing football, hiking and occasionally play the keyboard. I've also been getting into Basketball lately so feel free to bring it up in a conversation :]

I'm open to collaborate on Robotics and Machine learning projects and seek to contribute to the field of robotics.
