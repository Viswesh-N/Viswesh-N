I'm a second-year undergrad at IIT Kharagpur who loves programming.

I'm mostly a generalist at the moment, with maximum experience in backend development with Django. I've written several backend systems such as the one for Thought Processors ([Static Website](https://thoughtprocessors.netlify.app/)) and [StaightZero](https://straightzero.in). At StraightZero, I co-developed an authentication system, a payment system using the PayUMoney API, and a live test-taking platform in a team of just 2.

Aside from that, I've worked on various other projects in Python (API Consumers, Image Processing, Machine Learning, Web Scraping and other short scripts), some simulations in JS using p5.js, and have some competitive programming experience.

I'm currently a part of the Aerial Robotics Kharagpur (ARK) Research Group where I'm an undergraduate researcher working with Machine Learning and Computer Vision as part of the Perception team. I'm also a part of the Kharagpur Open Source Society (KOSS) and learning about various components of software development like architecture and the internals of certain programming languages. I've recently been exploring Deep Learning as well.

I'm open to collaborate on machine learning projects (academic or product-based) or web applications and I'm interested in internship opportunities for the summer of 2022.
